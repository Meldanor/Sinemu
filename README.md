# Sinemu - SImple NEtwork MUsic

A very simple music player on the web for your own music collection. It is written in Svelte.

## Motivation

I've a private music collection and everytime I want to listen to it, I'm using Foobar2000. It is a very simple music player with all the functionality I want. Simple playlits, simple UI, very fast. I want the same but as a server. Every solution I've tried over the years was limited, slow or bloated.

Sinemu uses your existing folder structure and serves it to your over the web. You can play complete folder hierachies with one click instead of only the current folder.

## Installation Server

You should use docker or any other container technology you are familiar with.
